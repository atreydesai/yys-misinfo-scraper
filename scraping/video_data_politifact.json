In one that received 2.9 million views, Baker said that the messages came from an Instagram user who called them \"true\" and asked him to share them with his 310,000 followers. In the other, Baker posted more screenshots of the supposed conversation. The three TikToks received more than 3.6 million views combined. We messaged the @cjbakerfitness account on TikTok to ask about the images\u2019 source. He shared screenshots of what looks like an Instagram direct message conversation between him and a person whose identity was cropped out of the screenshots. The thread showed this person told @cjbakerfitness that the purported Grindr exchange with Johnson was two years old. But the Johnson photo in the Grindr thread is cropped from a selfie Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Penn., posted publicly March 4, 2025, on X, showing the two of them inside the Capitol Hill Club, a Republican social club.

In a Nov. 7 interview on CNBC\u2019s \"Squawk on the Street,\" Wacksman spoke about Zillow\u2019s revenue growth amid a sluggish housing market. Co-host Sara Eisen turned to Trump\u2019s deportation plan, asking Wacksman, \"What President Trump had said about it is that, a lot of it, the affordability problems is due to illegal immigration and that after he carries out the \u2018largest deportation operation in history\u2019 that will ease prices by reducing demand. Do you agree? Are you optimistic that that can help?\" Wacksman said the real estate market has a supply-and-demand imbalance and that the country is chronically underbuilt.

Other research has pointed to regulatory red tape as a major culprit behind the low inventory. In some states, such as California, the combination of rules, regulations, permits, approval processes and fees dramatically increases construction timelines, making it costlier to build and pushing supply further behind. Zillow pointed to its research on housing affordability and its proposed solutions. These include policies that allow for new construction and standards that address regulatory restrictions at the local, regional, state and federal levels that would require a reexamination of zoning, financial, permitting and development practices.
