We will discuss this with the Americans and our Chinese partners,\u201d said Putin, who is heading to Beijing later Thursday.\n\nWhile Russia extended the invitation to Kim almost a year ago, the North Korean leader only accepted after his second summit with Trump broke down in February without agreements on relief from United Nations sanctions that are choking his economy or steps toward Kim\u2019s disarmament. Since then, North Korea has complained that intermediaries to Trump -- ranging from U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to the South Korean government -- aren\u2019t getting his message across.\n\n\u201cI had candid and meaningful talks with Putin on developing friendly relations between North Korea and Russia,\u201d Kim said at a reception with his Russian counterpart after the meetings.\n\nFor Putin, hosting Kim gives him a chance to remain a player in a security dispute shaped mainly by the U.S. and China. The Russian trip advances Kim\u2019s efforts to break his country\u2019s isolation. After ruling for six years without leaving home, he\u2019s visited five nations since his rapprochement with Trump, including China, Russia, Singapore, Vietnam and a short hop over the South Korean border.\n\nKim, who kept Putin waiting almost a year for the summit, was also more than 30 minutes behind the Russian president\u2019s arrival at the venue. That was an unusual turnabout for Putin, who\u2019s notorious for keeping world leaders waiting for meetings.\n\n\u201cWe welcome your efforts to develop inter-Korean dialogue and to normalize North Korean and American relations,\u201d Putin told Kim.\n\nNeither side released details of what was discussed at the meetings, which appeared cordial. Putin said he shares the U.S. desire to see full denuclearization, but added that North Korea would need security guarantees, most likely international, to protect its sovereignty. He said a return to six-party talks, an arrangement that included Russia and Japan, as well as China, the U.S. and the two Koreas, could be useful for that.\n\nKim, who arrived aboard an armored train Wednesday, hasn\u2019t met with the Russian leader since coming to power in 2011. But ties between Moscow and Pyongyang run deep with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin helping Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, set up the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in the aftermath of World War II.\n\n\u201cIf the Hanoi summit had gone well, North Korea would not have needed to visit Russia,\u201d said Kim Sung-han, dean of Korea University\u2019s Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul and a former vice minister at the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referring to Kim\u2019s failed meeting with Trump in February.\n\nBoxed in by Trump, Kim Jong Un Buys Time With Nod to 2020\n\nThe Russia trip comes after Kim gave a speech at the country\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament this month where he said he is willing to meet Trump again as long as the U.S. offers acceptable terms for a deal by year end.\n\nFor North Korea, \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t have the capacity to replace China,\u201d said Kim, the former vice foreign minister. \u201cInternally, it will help Kim show off his leadership to domestic elites but unless the trip generates tangible and physical support, it is just abstract.\u201d\n\nPutin suggested a compromise could be possible on North Korean migrant workers in Russia, an important source of income for the Pyongyang government that\u2019s due to be cut off at the end of this year under UN sanctions. He didn\u2019t elaborate, however.\n\n\u201cThis is essentially a side-show in the continuing saga between Pyongyang and Washington,\u201d Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, wrote on Twitter. \u201cRussia will seek to score diplomatic points by demonstrating its relevance; North Korea, by showing it has options.\u201d\n\nRead more: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/kim-seeks-support-from-putin-in-first-summit-amid-trump-tension\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nTICTOC ON SOCIAL:\nFollow TicToc on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tictoc\nLike TicToc on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tictoc\nFollow TicToc on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tictoc\n\nWatch all of TicToc\u2019s videos: https://www.tictoc.video/\n\nListen to TicToc\u2019s podcast: https://apple.co/2D3Vta7\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\n\nTicToc by Bloomberg is global news for the life you lead.

However, the orbiter's mission team is assessing whether observations can be made of any changes to the lunar environment associated with the moon crash and later identify the crater formed by the impact.\n\n\"This unique event presents an exciting research opportunity,\" NASA said in an emailed statement. \"Following the moon crash, the mission can use its cameras to identify the impact site, comparing older images to images taken after the moon crash. Searching for the impact crater will be challenging and might take weeks to months.\"\n\nIndia's Chandrayaan-2 orbiter may also be able to locate the moon crash crater, which could be up to 65 feet (20 meters) in diameter, Gray said. It will be far from the only crater on the moon crash site, which has no protective atmosphere. This means craters from moon crashes and natural impacts occur regularly.\n\nThere is a possibility of biocontamination at the moon crash site, since rocket parts aren't sterile when launched, said David Rothery, a professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University in the United Kingdom. \"Most microbes will have died, but maybe not all. They're probably not going to reproduce, but it's a very small risk,\" he said.\n\nThe origin of the rocket part involved in this moon crash is unclear. Gray had initially identified it as the SpaceX Falcon rocket stage that launched the US Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, in 2015 but later said he'd gotten that wrong. China\u2019s space agency denied the booster was from its Chang'e-5 moon mission, saying that the rocket in question burned up on reentry to Earth's atmosphere.\n\nNo agencies systematically track space debris so far away from Earth, and the confusion over the origin of the moon crash rocket stage has underscored the need for official agencies to monitor deep-space junk more closely, rather than relying on the limited resources of private individuals and academics.\n\nHowever, experts say the bigger challenge is the space debris in low-Earth orbit, an area where it can collide with functioning satellites, create more junk, and threaten human life on crewed spacecraft. There are at least 26,000 pieces of space junk orbiting Earth that are the size of a softball or larger and could destroy a satellite on impact; over 500,000 objects the size of a marble -- big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites; and over 100 million pieces the size of a grain of salt, tiny debris that could nonetheless puncture a spacesuit, according to a NASA report issued last year.\n\n00:00 Filming the moon\n00:13 Out of control rocket moving towards the moon\n00:22 Out of control rocket booster crashes into moon\n00:24 rocket crashes into moon\n00:30 march 4 2022 moon crash See my channel description for important details about how I create my content.",

I remember when we shot this video with Gabby and the kids, it was a weekend in early summer and it was absolutely beautiful weather and we all commented it was the perfect day. Gabby's step mother Tara was an angel to let her children be involved in this project along with her best friend Maija Polsley who is also in the video. This truly breaks my heart. I hope solace is brought to the family and friend's of Gabby. I know Gabby is in a better place. Only the good die young, I believe that. We will not let Gabby die in vain.
