# Fact-Checked Video Archive:  Snopes Debunks

This repo aims to create a curated archive of original videos sourced from fact-checked articles on Snopes.com.  It focuses on collecting videos that have been debunked or otherwise assessed for their veracity, providing a valuable resource for researchers, journalists, and anyone interested in studying misinformation and online content analysis.

## Data & Resources

*   **Google Colab Notebook:**  [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1InR4tkoAUvFAvzfvdBp-3nz9DFtkNaZ1?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1InR4tkoAUvFAvzfvdBp-3nz9DFtkNaZ1?usp=sharing)
    *   This notebook contains the Python code used for web scraping Snopes articles, extracting video links, downloading the videos, and generating the structured JSON data.

*   **Video Archive (Google Drive):** [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xo4YAo_WNHnhprUggGy0_He0Uhj_Mj9K?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xo4YAo_WNHnhprUggGy0_He0Uhj_Mj9K?usp=sharing)
    *   This folder stores the downloaded video files.  Each video is saved with a unique filename for easy reference.

*   **JSON Data File:** (Generated by the Colab notebook)
    * A JSON file is created that contains structured metadata for each collected video.  The structure is described below.

## Data Structure (JSON)

The collected data is organized in a JSON file with the following structure for each video entry:

```json
{
  "headline": "String",  // The title of the Snopes article.
  "subheadline": "String",  // A short excerpt from the post.
  "social_platform": "String",  // The platform where the video was first shared (e.g., Twitter, TikTok).
  "rating": "String",  // The Snopes fact-check result (e.g., "False", "Miscaptioned", "True").
  "social_link": "String",  // The direct link to the original post containing the video (e.g., a Twitter URL).
  "download_success: Boolean", //Whether or not the video was downloadable
  "download_message: String", //Includes ERROR messages and other outputs from CLI
  "drive_path": "String" //Path to direct link
}
```
## Other Notes

Trying this on a non-colab-based installation can lead to missing file paths. Also, note Selenium relies on a a web driver to interact with websites. This comes pre-installed with your pip dependency, but occasionally is missing. You can install this and debug further issues [here]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page#modifying-front-matter](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/troubleshooting/errors/driver_location/#download-the-driver)).
